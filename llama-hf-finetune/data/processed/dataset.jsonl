    {
      "prompt": "What are the benefits of using virtual environments in Python?",
      "response": "Virtual environments allow you to manage dependencies for different projects separately, avoiding conflicts and ensuring that each project has access to the specific packages it needs."

    {
      "prompt": "How does fine-tuning a pre-trained model work?",
      "response": "Fine-tuning a pre-trained model involves taking a model that has already been trained on a large dataset and continuing the training process on a smaller, task-specific dataset to adapt the model to the new task."

    {
      "prompt": "What is the purpose of hyperparameter tuning?",
      "response": "Hyperparameter tuning aims to find the optimal set of hyperparameters for a model to improve its performance on a specific task, often through techniques like grid search or random search."

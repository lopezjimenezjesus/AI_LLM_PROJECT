{"data": [{"prompt": "What is the capital of France?", "response": "The capital of France is Paris."}, {"prompt": "Explain the theory of relativity.", "response": "The theory of relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, consists of two theories: special relativity and general relativity. Special relativity addresses the physics of objects moving at constant speeds, particularly at speeds close to the speed of light, and introduces the concept that the laws of physics are the same for all observers regardless of their relative motion. General relativity extends this concept to include acceleration and gravity, describing gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass."}, {"prompt": "What are the benefits of exercise?", "response": "Exercise has numerous benefits, including improved cardiovascular health, increased strength and flexibility, better mental health, weight management, and enhanced overall well-being. Regular physical activity can also reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease."}]}
